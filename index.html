              My name is Aimee Esler and I am currently a student in the Georgia
              Tech Coding Boot Camp program. I was born and raised in Bonita
              Springs, a tiny town in southwest Florida. I went to the
              University of Florida (Go Gators!) and graduated with Bachelors
              degree in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. After graduation I
              also attended the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo and went on to
              work in my dream job as a lead mammals Zookeeper at Naples Zoo in
              Naples, FL. Unfortunately, as we all learn at some point in life,
              even our "dream jobs" come with their issues and I made the
              difficult decision six years ago to change careers and move to
              Atlanta, GA. For the last six years I have been working as a data
              analyst/administrative assistant and I felt like I had reached my
              maximum potential in this field. I wanted to start a new challenge
              in a field I knew I could learn and grow in for the rest of my
              career... enter web development!
            </p>

              I just recently got married on February 22nd, 2020 to my husband
              Matt, who I met through mutual friends shortly after I moved to
              Atlanta. We love to travel anywhere we can but we especially love
              Scotland and even named our dog, Islay, after our favorite place
              there! When I'm not travelling you can usually find me curled up
              with a good book, binge-watching a new tv show, outside hiking
              with friends, or taking my dog to the park. True to my roots, I
              also love to spend a day at the zoo with my niece and nephews,
              they are the only ones who are impressed by my vast wealth of
              useless animal knowledge!
